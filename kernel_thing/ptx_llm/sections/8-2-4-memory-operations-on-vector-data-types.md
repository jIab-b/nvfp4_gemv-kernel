### 8.2.4. Memory Operations on Vector Data Types 

The memory consistency model relates operations executed on memory locations with scalar data types,
which have a maximum size and alignment of 64 bits. Memory operations with a vector data type are
modelled as a set of equivalent memory operations with a scalar data type, executed in an
unspecified order on the elements in the vector.
