## 6.5. Type Conversion 

All operands to all arithmetic, logic, and data movement instruction must be of the same type and
size, except for operations where changing the size and/or type is part of the definition of the
instruction. Operands of different sizes or types must be converted prior to the operation.

### 6.5.1. [Scalar Conversions](#scalar-conversions)[](#scalar-conversions "Permalink to this headline")

[Table 15](#scalar-conversions-convert-instruction-precision-and-format-t1) and
[Table 16](#scalar-conversions-convert-instruction-precision-and-format-t2) show what
precision and format the cvt instruction uses given operands of differing types. For example, if a
`cvt.s32.u16` instruction is given a `u16` source operand and `s32` as a destination operand,
the `u16` is zero-extended to `s32`.

Conversions to floating-point that are beyond the range of floating-point numbers are represented
with the maximum floating-point value (IEEE 754 Inf for `f32` and `f64`, and ~131,000 for
`f16`).

**Notes**

sext = sign-extend; zext = zero-extend; chop = keep only low bits that fit;

s2f = signed-to-float; f2s = float-to-signed; u2f = unsigned-to-float;

f2u = float-to-unsigned; f2f = float-to-float.

1 If the destination register is wider than the destination format, the result is extended to the
destination register width after chopping. The type of extension (sign or zero) is based on the
destination format. For example, cvt.s16.u32 targeting a 32-bit register first chops to 16-bit, then
sign-extends to 32-bit.

### 6.5.2. [Rounding Modifiers](#rounding-modifiers)[](#rounding-modifiers "Permalink to this headline")

Conversion instructions may specify a rounding modifier. In PTX, there are four integer rounding
modifiers and six floating-point rounding
modifiers. [Table 17](#rounding-modifiers-floating-point-rounding-modifiers) and
[Table 18](#rounding-modifiers-integer-rounding-modifiers) summarize the rounding modifiers.

Table 17 Floating-Point Rounding Modifiers[](#rounding-modifiers-floating-point-rounding-modifiers "Permalink to this table")




| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.rn` | rounds to nearest even |
| `.rna` | rounds to nearest, ties away from zero |
| `.rz` | rounds towards zero |
| `.rm` | rounds towards negative infinity |
| `.rp` | rounds towards positive infinity |
| `.rs` | rounds either towards zero or away from zero based on the carry out of the integer addition of random bits and the discarded bits of mantissa |

Table 18 Integer Rounding Modifiers[](#rounding-modifiers-integer-rounding-modifiers "Permalink to this table")




| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `.rni` | round to nearest integer, choosing even integer if source is equidistant between two integers. |
| `.rzi` | round to nearest integer in the direction of zero |
| `.rmi` | round to nearest integer in direction of negative infinity |
| `.rpi` | round to nearest integer in direction of positive infinity |
