##### 9.7.16.3.2. Stride Dimension Byte Offset 

The stride dimension byte offset is defined differently for transposed and non-transposed
matrices. The stride dimension byte offset is defined as follows for matrices whose element
types are normalized to 128-bits:

| Major-ness | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| K-Major | The offset from the first 8 rows to the next 8 rows. |
| MN-Major | * Interleave: offset from the first row to the next row. * Swizzled layout: offset from the first 8 columns to the next 8   columns |
