## 4.5. Constants 

PTX supports integer and floating-point constants and constant expressions. These constants may be
used in data initialization and as operands to instructions. Type checking rules remain the same for
integer, floating-point, and bit-size types. For predicate-type data and instructions, integer
constants are allowed and are interpreted as in C, i.e., zero values are `False` and non-zero
values are `True`.

### 4.5.1. [Integer Constants](#integer-constants)[](#integer-constants "Permalink to this headline")

Integer constants are 64-bits in size and are either signed or unsigned, i.e., every integer
constant has type `.s64` or `.u64`. The signed/unsigned nature of an integer constant is needed
to correctly evaluate constant expressions containing operations such as division and ordered
comparisons, where the behavior of the operation depends on the operand types. When used in an
instruction or data initialization, each integer constant is converted to the appropriate size based
on the data or instruction type at its use.

Integer literals may be written in decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary notation. The syntax
follows that of C. Integer literals may be followed immediately by the letter `U` to indicate that
the literal is unsigned.

```
hexadecimal literal:  0[xX]{hexdigit}+U?

octal literal:        0{octal digit}+U?

binary literal:       0[bB]{bit}+U?

decimal literal       {nonzero-digit}{digit}*U?
```

Integer literals are non-negative and have a type determined by their magnitude and optional type
suffix as follows: literals are signed (`.s64`) unless the value cannot be fully represented in
`.s64` or the unsigned suffix is specified, in which case the literal is unsigned (`.u64`).

The predefined integer constant `WARP_SZ` specifies the number of threads per warp for the target
platform; to date, all target architectures have a `WARP_SZ` value of 32.

### 4.5.2. [Floating-Point Constants](#floating-point-constants)[](#floating-point-constants "Permalink to this headline")

Floating-point constants are represented as 64-bit double-precision values, and all floating-point
constant expressions are evaluated using 64-bit double precision arithmetic. The only exception is
the 32-bit hex notation for expressing an exact single-precision floating-point value; such values
retain their exact 32-bit single-precision value and may not be used in constant expressions. Each
64-bit floating-point constant is converted to the appropriate floating-point size based on the data
or instruction type at its use.

Floating-point literals may be written with an optional decimal point and an optional signed
exponent. Unlike C and C++, there is no suffix letter to specify size; literals are always
represented in 64-bit double-precision format.

PTX includes a second representation of floating-point constants for specifying the exact machine
representation using a hexadecimal constant. To specify IEEE 754 double-precision floating point
values, the constant begins with `0d` or `0D` followed by 16 hex digits. To specify IEEE 754
single-precision floating point values, the constant begins with `0f` or `0F` followed by 8 hex
digits.

```
0[fF]{hexdigit}{8}      // single-precision floating point

0[dD]{hexdigit}{16}     // double-precision floating point
```

Example

```
mov.f32  $f3, 0F3f800000;       //  1.0
```

### 4.5.3. [Predicate Constants](#predicate-constants)[](#predicate-constants "Permalink to this headline")

In PTX, integer constants may be used as predicates. For predicate-type data initializers and
instruction operands, integer constants are interpreted as in C, i.e., zero values are `False` and
non-zero values are `True`.

### 4.5.4. [Constant Expressions](#constant-expressions)[](#constant-expressions "Permalink to this headline")

In PTX, constant expressions are formed using operators as in C and are evaluated using rules
similar to those in C, but simplified by restricting types and sizes, removing most casts, and
defining full semantics to eliminate cases where expression evaluation in C is implementation
dependent.

Constant expressions are formed from constant literals, unary plus and minus, basic arithmetic
operators (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), comparison operators, the conditional
ternary operator ( `?:` ), and parentheses. Integer constant expressions also allow unary logical
negation (`!`), bitwise complement (`~`), remainder (`%`), shift operators (`<<` and
`>>`), bit-type operators (`&`, `|`, and `^`), and logical operators (`&&`, `||`).

Constant expressions in PTX do not support casts between integer and floating-point.

Constant expressions are evaluated using the same operator precedence as
in C. [Table 4](#constant-expressions-operator-precedence) gives operator precedence and
associativity. Operator precedence is highest for unary operators and decreases with each line in
the chart. Operators on the same line have the same precedence and are evaluated right-to-left for
unary operators and left-to-right for binary operators.

### 4.5.5. [Integer Constant Expression Evaluation](#integer-constant-expression-evaluation)[](#integer-constant-expression-evaluation "Permalink to this headline")

Integer constant expressions are evaluated at compile time according to a set of rules that
determine the type (signed `.s64` versus unsigned `.u64`) of each sub-expression. These rules
are based on the rules in C, but they’ve been simplified to apply only to 64-bit integers, and
behavior is fully defined in all cases (specifically, for remainder and shift operators).

* Literals are signed unless unsigned is needed to prevent overflow, or unless the literal uses a
  `U` suffix. For example:

  + `42`, `0x1234`, `0123` are signed.
  + `0xfabc123400000000`, `42U`, `0x1234U` are unsigned.
* Unary plus and minus preserve the type of the input operand. For example:

  + `+123`, `-1`, `-(-42)` are signed.
  + `-1U`, `-0xfabc123400000000` are unsigned.
* Unary logical negation (`!`) produces a signed result with value `0` or `1`.
* Unary bitwise complement (`~`) interprets the source operand as unsigned and produces an
  unsigned result.
* Some binary operators require normalization of source operands. This normalization is known as
  *the usual arithmetic conversions* and simply converts both operands to unsigned type if either
  operand is unsigned.
* Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division perform the usual arithmetic conversions and
  produce a result with the same type as the converted operands. That is, the operands and result
  are unsigned if either source operand is unsigned, and is otherwise signed.
* Remainder (`%`) interprets the operands as unsigned. Note that this differs from C, which allows
  a negative divisor but defines the behavior to be implementation dependent.
* Left and right shift interpret the second operand as unsigned and produce a result with the same
  type as the first operand. Note that the behavior of right-shift is determined by the type of the
  first operand: right shift of a signed value is arithmetic and preserves the sign, and right shift
  of an unsigned value is logical and shifts in a zero bit.
* AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) perform the usual arithmetic conversions and produce a
  result with the same type as the converted operands.
* AND\_OP (`&&`), OR\_OP (`||`), Equal (`==`), and Not\_Equal (`!=`) produce a signed
  result. The result value is 0 or 1.
* Ordered comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) perform the usual arithmetic conversions on
  source operands and produce a signed result. The result value is `0` or `1`.
* Casting of expressions to signed or unsigned is supported using (`.s64`) and (`.u64`) casts.
* For the conditional operator ( `? :` ) , the first operand must be an integer, and the second
  and third operands are either both integers or both floating-point. The usual arithmetic
  conversions are performed on the second and third operands, and the result type is the same as the
  converted type.
