# 12. Descriptions of .pragma Strings 

This section describes the `.pragma` strings defined by ptxas.

12.1. [Pragma Strings: `"nounroll"`](#pragma-strings-nounroll)[](#pragma-strings-nounroll "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`"nounroll"`

Disable loop unrolling in optimizing the backend compiler.

Syntax

```
.pragma "nounroll";
```

Description

The `"nounroll" pragma` is a directive to disable loop unrolling in the optimizing backend
compiler.

The `"nounroll" pragma` is allowed at module, entry-function, and statement levels, with the
following meanings:

module scope
:   disables unrolling for all loops in module, including loops preceding the `.pragma`.

entry-function scope
:   disables unrolling for all loops in the entry function body.

statement-level pragma
:   disables unrolling of the loop for which the current block is the loop header.

Note that in order to have the desired effect at statement level, the `"nounroll"` directive must
appear before any instruction statements in the loop header basic block for the desired loop. The
loop header block is defined as the block that dominates all blocks in the loop body and is the
target of the loop backedge. Statement-level `"nounroll"` directives appearing outside of loop
header blocks are silently ignored.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_20` or higher. Ignored for `sm_1x` targets.

Examples

```
.entry foo (...)

.pragma "nounroll";  // do not unroll any loop in this function

{

...

}



.func bar (...)

{

...

L1_head:

     .pragma "nounroll";  // do not unroll this loop

     ...

@p   bra L1_end;

L1_body:

     ...

L1_continue:

     bra L1_head;

L1_end:

     ...

}
```

12.2. [Pragma Strings: `"used_bytes_mask"`](#pragma-strings-used-bytes-mask)[](#pragma-strings-used-bytes-mask "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`"used_bytes_mask"`

Mask for indicating used bytes in data of ld operation.

Syntax

```
.pragma "used_bytes_mask mask";
```

Description

The `"used_bytes_mask" pragma` is a directive that specifies used bytes in a load
operation based on the mask provided.

`"used_bytes_mask" pragma` needs to be specified prior to a load instruction for which
information about bytes used from the load operation is needed.
Pragma is ignored if instruction following it is not a load instruction.

For a load instruction without this pragma, all bytes from the load operation are assumed
to be used.

Operand `mask` is a 32-bit integer with set bits indicating the used bytes in data of
load operation.

Semantics

```
Each bit in mask operand corresponds to a byte data where each set bit represents the used byte.

Most-significant bit corresponds to most-significant byte of data.



// For 4 bytes load with only lower 3 bytes used

.pragma "used_bytes_mask 0x7";

ld.global.u32 %r0, [gbl];     // Higher 1 byte from %r0 is unused



// For vector load of 16 bytes with lower 12 bytes used

.pragma "used_bytes_mask 0xfff";

ld.global.v4.u32 {%r0, %r1, %r2, %r3}, [gbl];  // %r3 unused
```

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 8.3.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_50` or higher.

Examples

```
.pragma "used_bytes_mask 0xfff";

ld.global.v4.u32 {%r0, %r1, %r2, %r3}, [gbl]; // Only lower 12 bytes used
```

12.3. [Pragma Strings: `"enable_smem_spilling"`](#pragma-strings-enable-smem-spilling)[](#pragma-strings-enable-smem-spilling "Permalink to this headline")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`"enable_smem_spilling"`

Enable shared memory spilling for CUDA kernels.

Syntax

```
.pragma "enable_smem_spilling";
```

Description

The `"enable_smem_spilling" pragma` is a directive that enables register spilling into shared memory.
During the spilling process, registers are first spilled into shared memory, and once the allocated
shared memory is full, any additional spills are redirected to local memory. This can enhance
performance by reducing memory access latency since shared memory accesses are faster than local memory.

The `"enable_smem_spilling" pragma` is only allowed within the function scope. When applied, it enables
shared memory spilling for the specified function.

The usage of pragma is valid only in certain scenarios and specific compilation modes. The usage of
pragma is disallowed under following cases and may result in an error:

* Per-function compilation mode: e.g., Separate Compilation, Device-debug, Whole program with recursive
  function calls, Extensible-whole-program
* Kernels utilizing dynamically allocated shared memory
* Kernels using `setmaxnreg` instruction

Note

If launch bounds are not explicitly specified, the compiler assumes the maximum possible number of
threads per CTA to estimate shared memory allocated per CTA and corresponding spill size. However,
if the kernel is launched with fewer threads per CTA than estimated, the shared memory allocated
per CTA may exceed the compiler estimated size, thereby potentially limiting the number of CTAs
that can be launched on an SM. Due to this, using the pragma without launch bounds may lead to
performance regressions. Hence it is recommended to use this pragma only when launch bounds are
explicitly specified.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 9.0.

Target ISA Notes

Requires `sm_75` or higher.

Examples

```
.entry foo (...)

{

    ...

    .pragma "enable_smem_spilling";   // Enable shared memory spilling for this function

    ...

}
```

12.4. [Pragma Strings: `"frequency"`](#pragma-strings-frequency)[](#pragma-strings-frequency "Permalink to this headline")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`"frequency"`

Specify frequency for basic block execution.

Syntax

```
.pragma "frequency n";
```

Description

The `"frequency" pragma` is a directive that specifies the number of times a basic block is
executed by an executing thread. The optimizing compiler backend treats this pragma as a hint
which will be used for optimizations.

Operand `n` is a 64-bit non-negative integer constant that specifies the execution frequency.

Note that in order to have the desired effect of this pragma, it should be specified at the start of
the basic block. Basic block is defined as a straight-line sequence of instructions with only one
entry point and one exit point.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 9.0.

Target ISA Notes

Supported on all target architectures.

Examples

```
.entry foo (...)

{

    .pragma "frequency 32";

    ...

}
```
