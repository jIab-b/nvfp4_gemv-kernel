## 13.30. Changes in PTX ISA Version 4.0 

New Features

PTX ISA version 4.0 introduces the following new features:

* Support for `sm_32` and `sm_50` target architectures.
* Support for 64bit performance counter special registers `%pm0_64,..,%pm7_64`.
* A new `istypep` instruction.
* A new instruction, `rsqrt.approx.ftz.f64` has been added to compute a fast approximation of the
  square root reciprocal of a value.
* Support for a new directive `.attribute` for specifying special attributes of a variable.
* Support for `.managed` variable attribute.

Semantic Changes and Clarifications

The `vote` instruction semantics were updated to clearly indicate that an inactive thread in a
warp contributes a 0 for its entry when participating in `vote.ballot.b32`.
