### 8.2.5. Memory Operations on Packed Data Types 

A packed data type consists of two values of the same scalar data type, as described in
[Packed Data Types](#packed-data-types). These values are accessed in adjacent memory locations. A
memory operation on a packed data type is modelled as a pair of equivalent memory operations on the
scalar data type, executed in an unspecified order on each element of the packed data.
