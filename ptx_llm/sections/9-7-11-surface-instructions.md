### 9.7.11. Surface Instructions 

This section describes PTX instructions for accessing surfaces. PTX supports the following
operations on surface descriptors:

* Static initialization of surface descriptors.
* Module-scope and per-entry scope definitions of surface descriptors.
* Ability to query fields within surface descriptors.

These instructions provide access to surface memory.

* `suld`
* `sust`
* `sured`
* `suq`

#### 9.7.11.1. [Surface Instructions: `suld`](#surface-instructions-suld)[](#surface-instructions-suld "Permalink to this headline")

`suld`

Load from surface memory.

Syntax

```
suld.b.geom{.cop}.vec.dtype.clamp  d, [a, b];  // unformatted



.geom  = { .1d, .2d, .3d, .a1d, .a2d };

.cop   = { .ca, .cg, .cs, .cv };               // cache operation

.vec   = { none, .v2, .v4 };

.dtype = { .b8 , .b16, .b32, .b64 };

.clamp = { .trap, .clamp, .zero };
```

Description

`suld.b.{1d,2d,3d}`

Load from surface memory using a surface coordinate vector. The instruction loads data from the
surface named by operand `a` at coordinates given by operand `b` into destination `d`. Operand
`a` is a `.surfref` variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a scalar or singleton tuple
for 1d surfaces; is a two-element vector for 2d surfaces; and is a four-element vector for 3d
surfaces, where the fourth element is ignored. Coordinate elements are of type `.s32`.

`suld.b` performs an unformatted load of binary data. The lowest dimension coordinate represents a
byte offset into the surface and is not scaled, and the size of the data transfer matches the size
of destination operand `d`.

`suld.b.{a1d,a2d}`

Surface layer selection, followed by a load from the selected surface. The instruction first selects
a surface layer from the surface array named by operand `a` using the index given by the first
element of the array coordinate vector `b`. The instruction then loads data from the selected
surface at coordinates given by the remaining elements of operand `b` into destination
`d`. Operand `a` is a `.surfref` variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a bit-size
type vector or tuple containing an index into the array of surfaces followed by coordinates within
the selected surface, as follows:

For 1d surface arrays, operand `b` has type `.v2.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the surface array, and the second element is interpreted as a
1d surface coordinate of type `.s32`.

For 2d surface arrays, operand `b` has type `.v4.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the surface array, and the next two elements are interpreted
as 2d surface coordinates of type `.s32`. The fourth element is ignored.

A surface base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

The `.clamp` field specifies how to handle out-of-bounds addresses:

`.trap`
:   causes an execution trap on out-of-bounds addresses

`.clamp`
:   loads data at the nearest surface location (sized appropriately)

`.zero`
:   loads zero for out-of-bounds addresses

Indirect surface access

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1, indirect surface access is supported for target architecture
`sm_20` or higher. In indirect access, operand `a` is a `.u64` register holding the address of
a `.surfref` variable.

PTX ISA Notes

`suld.b.trap` introduced in PTX ISA version 1.5.

Additional clamp modifiers and cache operations introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

`suld.b.3d` and `suld.b.{a1d,a2d}` introduced in PTX ISA version 3.0.

Indirect surface access introduced in PTX ISA version 3.1.

Target ISA Notes

`suld.b` supported on all target architectures.

`sm_1x` targets support only the `.trap` clamping modifier.

`suld.3d` and `suld.{a1d,a2d}` require `sm_20` or higher.

Indirect surface access requires `sm_20` or higher.

Cache operations require `sm_20` or higher.

Examples

```
suld.b.1d.v4.b32.trap  {s1,s2,s3,s4}, [surf_B, {x}];

suld.b.3d.v2.b64.trap  {r1,r2}, [surf_A, {x,y,z,w}];

suld.b.a1d.v2.b32      {r0,r1}, [surf_C, {idx,x}];

suld.b.a2d.b32         r0, [surf_D, {idx,x,y,z}];  // z ignored
```

#### 9.7.11.2. [Surface Instructions: `sust`](#surface-instructions-sust)[](#surface-instructions-sust "Permalink to this headline")

`sust`

Store to surface memory.

Syntax

```
sust.b.{1d,2d,3d}{.cop}.vec.ctype.clamp  [a, b], c;  // unformatted

sust.p.{1d,2d,3d}.vec.b32.clamp          [a, b], c;  // formatted



sust.b.{a1d,a2d}{.cop}.vec.ctype.clamp   [a, b], c;  // unformatted



.cop   = { .wb, .cg, .cs, .wt };                     // cache operation

.vec   = { none, .v2, .v4 };

.ctype = { .b8 , .b16, .b32, .b64 };

.clamp = { .trap, .clamp, .zero };
```

Description

`sust.{1d,2d,3d}`

Store to surface memory using a surface coordinate vector. The instruction stores data from operand
`c` to the surface named by operand `a` at coordinates given by operand `b`. Operand `a` is
a `.surfref` variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a scalar or singleton tuple for 1d
surfaces; is a two-element vector for 2d surfaces; and is a four-element vector for 3d surfaces,
where the fourth element is ignored. Coordinate elements are of type `.s32`.

`sust.b` performs an unformatted store of binary data. The lowest dimension coordinate represents
a byte offset into the surface and is not scaled. The size of the data transfer matches the size of
source operand `c`.

`sust.p` performs a formatted store of a vector of 32-bit data values to a surface sample. The
source vector elements are interpreted left-to-right as `R`, `G`, `B`, and `A` surface
components. These elements are written to the corresponding surface sample components. Source
elements that do not occur in the surface sample are ignored. Surface sample components that do not
occur in the source vector will be written with an unpredictable value. The lowest dimension
coordinate represents a sample offset rather than a byte offset.

The source data interpretation is based on the surface sample format as follows: If the surface
format contains `UNORM`, `SNORM`, or `FLOAT` data, then `.f32` is assumed; if the surface
format contains `UINT` data, then `.u32` is assumed; if the surface format contains `SINT`
data, then `.s32` is assumed. The source data is then converted from this type to the surface
sample format.

`sust.b.{a1d,a2d}`

Surface layer selection, followed by an unformatted store to the selected surface. The instruction
first selects a surface layer from the surface array named by operand `a` using the index given by
the first element of the array coordinate vector `b`. The instruction then stores the data in
operand `c` to the selected surface at coordinates given by the remaining elements of operand
`b`. Operand `a` is a .surfref variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a bit-size type
vector or tuple containing an index into the array of surfaces followed by coordinates within the
selected surface, as follows:

* For 1d surface arrays, operand `b` has type `.v2.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
  unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the surface array, and the second element is interpreted as
  a 1d surface coordinate of type `.s32`.
* For 2d surface arrays, operand `b` has type `.v4.b32`. The first element is interpreted as an
  unsigned integer index (`.u32`) into the surface array, and the next two elements are
  interpreted as 2d surface coordinates of type `.s32`. The fourth element is ignored.

A surface base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

The `.clamp` field specifies how to handle out-of-bounds addresses:

`.trap`
:   causes an execution trap on out-of-bounds addresses

`.clamp`
:   stores data at the nearest surface location (sized appropriately)

`.zero`
:   drops stores to out-of-bounds addresses

Indirect surface access

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1, indirect surface access is supported for target architecture
`sm_20` or higher. In indirect access, operand `a` is a `.u64` register holding the address of
a `.surfref` variable.

cache operations introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

`sust.b.3d` and `sust.b.{a1d,a2d}` introduced in PTX ISA version 3.0.

Indirect surface access introduced in PTX ISA version 3.1.

#### 9.7.11.3. [Surface Instructions: `sured`](#surface-instructions-sured)[](#surface-instructions-sured "Permalink to this headline")

`sured`

Reduce surface memory.

Syntax

```
sured.b.op.geom.ctype.clamp  [a,b],c; // byte addressing

sured.p.op.geom.ctype.clamp  [a,b],c; // sample addressing



.op    = { .add, .min, .max, .and, .or };

.geom  = { .1d, .2d, .3d };

.ctype = { .u32, .u64, .s32, .b32, .s64 };  // for sured.b

.ctype = { .b32, .b64 };                    // for sured.p

.clamp = { .trap, .clamp, .zero };
```

Description

Reduction to surface memory using a surface coordinate vector. The instruction performs a reduction
operation with data from operand `c` to the surface named by operand `a` at coordinates given by
operand `b`. Operand `a` is a `.surfref` variable or `.u64` register. Operand `b` is a
scalar or singleton tuple for 1d surfaces; is a two-element vector for 2d surfaces; and is a
four-element vector for 3d surfaces, where the fourth element is ignored. Coordinate elements are of
type `.s32`.

`sured.b` performs an unformatted reduction on `.u32`, `.s32`, `.b32`, `.u64`, or `.s64`
data. The lowest dimension coordinate represents a byte offset into the surface and is not
scaled. Operation `add` applies to `.u32`, `.u64`, and `.s32` types; `min` and `max`
apply to `.u32`, `.s32`, `.u64` and `.s64` types; operations `and` and `or` apply to
`.b32` type.

`sured.p` performs a reduction on sample-addressed data. The lowest dimension coordinate
represents a sample offset rather than a byte offset. The instruction type `.b64` is restricted to
`min` and `max` operations. For type `.b32`, the data is interpreted as `.u32` or `.s32`
based on the surface sample format as follows: if the surface format contains `UINT` data, then
`.u32` is assumed; if the surface format contains `SINT` data, then `.s32` is assumed. For
type `.b64`, if the surface format contains `UINT` data, then `.u64` is assumed; if the
surface format contains `SINT` data, then `.s64` is assumed.

A surface base address is assumed to be aligned to a 16 byte boundary, and the address given by the
coordinate vector must be naturally aligned to a multiple of the access size. If an address is not
properly aligned, the resulting behavior is undefined; i.e., the access may proceed by silently
masking off low-order address bits to achieve proper rounding, or the instruction may fault.

The `.clamp` field specifies how to handle out-of-bounds addresses:

`.trap`
:   causes an execution trap on out-of-bounds addresses

`.clamp`
:   stores data at the nearest surface location (sized appropriately)

`.zero`
:   drops stores to out-of-bounds addresses

Indirect surface access

Beginning with PTX ISA version 3.1, indirect surface access is supported for target architecture
`sm_20` or higher. In indirect access, operand `a` is a `.u64` register holding the address of
a `.surfref` variable.

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 2.0.

Indirect surface access introduced in PTX ISA version 3.1.

`.u64`/`.s64`/`.b64` types with `.min`/`.max` operations introduced in PTX ISA version

Target ISA Notes

sured requires `sm_20` or higher.

Indirect surface access requires `sm_20` or higher.

`.u64`/`.s64`/`.b64` types with `.min`/`.max` operations requires `sm_50` or higher.

Examples

sured.p.min.1d.u32.trap  [surf_B, {x}], r1;

sured.b.max.1d.u64.trap  [surf_C, {x}], r1;

sured.p.min.1d.b64.trap  [surf_D, {x}], r1;
