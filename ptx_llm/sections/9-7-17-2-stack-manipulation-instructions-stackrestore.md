#### 9.7.17.2. Stack Manipulation Instructions: stackrestore 

`stackrestore`

Update the stack pointer with a new value.

Syntax

```
stackrestore.type  a;



.type = { .u32, .u64 };
```

Description

Sets the current stack pointer to source register `a`.

When `stackrestore` is used with operand `a` written by a prior `stacksave` instruction, it
will effectively restore the state of stack as it was before `stacksave` was executed. Note that
if `stackrestore` is used with an arbitrary value of `a`, it may cause corruption of stack
pointer. This implies that the correct use of this feature requires that `stackrestore.type a` is
used after `stacksave.type a` without redefining the value of `a` between them.

Operand `a` has the same type as the instruction type.

Semantics

```
stackptr = a;
```

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.3.

Preview Feature:
:   `stackrestore` is a preview feature in PTX ISA version 7.3. All details are subject to change
    with no guarantees of backward compatibility on future PTX ISA versions or SM architectures.

Target ISA Notes

`stackrestore` requires `sm_52` or higher.

Examples

```
.reg .u32 ra;

stacksave.u32 ra;

// Code that may modify stack pointer

...

stackrestore.u32 ra;
```
