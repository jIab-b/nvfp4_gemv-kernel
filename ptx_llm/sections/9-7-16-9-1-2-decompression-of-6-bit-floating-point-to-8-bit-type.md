###### 9.7.16.9.1.2. Decompression of 6-bit floating point to 8-bit type 

A contiguous set of 16 elements of 6-bits each followed by 4 bytes of padding is
decompressed into 16 elements of 8-bits each as shown in [Figure 196](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b).

The individual 6-bit to 8-bit decompression for types `E3M2` and `E2M3` is shown in
[Figure 197](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b-individual1) and [Figure 198](#tcgen05-decompression-6b8b-individual2)
respectively.
