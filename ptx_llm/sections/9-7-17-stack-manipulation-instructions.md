### 9.7.17. Stack Manipulation Instructions 

The stack manipulation instructions can be used to dynamically allocate and deallocate memory on the
stack frame of the current function.

The stack manipulation instrucitons are:

* `stacksave`
* `stackrestore`
* `alloca`

#### 9.7.17.1. [Stack Manipulation Instructions: `stacksave`](#stack-manipulation-instructions-stacksave)[](#stack-manipulation-instructions-stacksave "Permalink to this headline")

`stacksave`

Save the value of stack pointer into a register.

Syntax

```
stacksave.type  d;



.type = { .u32, .u64 };
```

Description

Copies the current value of stack pointer into the destination register `d`. Pointer returned by
`stacksave` can be used in a subsequent `stackrestore` instruction to restore the stack
pointer. If `d` is modified prior to use in `stackrestore` instruction, it may corrupt data in
the stack.

Destination operand `d` has the same type as the instruction type.

Semantics

```
d = stackptr;
```

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.3.

Preview Feature:
:   `stacksave` is a preview feature in PTX ISA version 7.3. All details are subject to change with
    no guarantees of backward compatibility on future PTX ISA versions or SM architectures.

Target ISA Notes

`stacksave` requires `sm_52` or higher.

Examples

```
.reg .u32 rd;

stacksave.u32 rd;



.reg .u64 rd1;

stacksave.u64 rd1;
```

#### 9.7.17.2. [Stack Manipulation Instructions: `stackrestore`](#stack-manipulation-instructions-stackrestore)[](#stack-manipulation-instructions-stackrestore "Permalink to this headline")

`stackrestore`

Update the stack pointer with a new value.

Syntax

```
stackrestore.type  a;



.type = { .u32, .u64 };
```

Description

Sets the current stack pointer to source register `a`.

When `stackrestore` is used with operand `a` written by a prior `stacksave` instruction, it
will effectively restore the state of stack as it was before `stacksave` was executed. Note that
if `stackrestore` is used with an arbitrary value of `a`, it may cause corruption of stack
pointer. This implies that the correct use of this feature requires that `stackrestore.type a` is
used after `stacksave.type a` without redefining the value of `a` between them.

Operand `a` has the same type as the instruction type.

Semantics

```
stackptr = a;
```

PTX ISA Notes

Introduced in PTX ISA version 7.3.

Preview Feature:
:   `stackrestore` is a preview feature in PTX ISA version 7.3. All details are subject to change
    with no guarantees of backward compatibility on future PTX ISA versions or SM architectures.

Target ISA Notes

`stackrestore` requires `sm_52` or higher.

Examples

```
.reg .u32 ra;

stacksave.u32 ra;

// Code that may modify stack pointer

...

stackrestore.u32 ra;
```

#### 9.7.17.3. [Stack Manipulation Instructions: `alloca`](#stack-manipulation-instructions-alloca)[](#stack-manipulation-instructions-alloca "Permalink to this headline")

`alloca`

Dynamically allocate memory on stack.

Syntax

```
alloca.type  ptr, size{, immAlign};



.type = { .u32, .u64 };
```

Description

The `alloca` instruction dynamically allocates memory on the stack frame of the current function
and updates the stack pointer accordingly. The returned pointer `ptr` points to local memory and
can be used in the address operand of `ld.local` and `st.local` instructions.

If sufficient memory is unavailable for allocation on the stack, then execution of `alloca` may
result in stack overflow. In such cases, attempting to access the allocated memory with `ptr` will
result in undefined program behavior.

The memory allocated by `alloca` is deallocated in the following ways:

* It is automatically deallocated when the function exits.
* It can be explicitly deallocated using `stacksave` and `stackrestore` instructions:
  `stacksave` can be used to save the value of stack pointer before executing `alloca`, and
  `stackrestore` can be used after `alloca` to restore stack pointer to the original value which
  was previously saved with `stacksave`. Note that accessing deallocated memory after executing
  `stackrestore` results in undefined behavior.

`size` is an unsigned value which specifies the amount of memory in number of bytes to be
allocated on stack. `size = 0` may not lead to a valid memory allocation.

Both `ptr` and `size` have the same type as the instruction type.

`immAlign` is a 32-bit value which specifies the alignment requirement in number of bytes for the
memory allocated by `alloca`. It is an integer constant, must be a power of 2 and must not exceed
2^23. `immAlign` is an optional argument with default value being 8 which is the minimum
guaranteed alignment.

Semantics

```
alloca.type ptr, size, immAlign:



a = max(immAlign, frame_align); // frame_align is the minimum guaranteed alignment



// Allocate size bytes of stack memory with alignment a and update the stack pointer.

// Since the stack grows down, the updated stack pointer contains a lower address.

stackptr = alloc_stack_mem(size, a);



// Return the new value of stack pointer as ptr. Since ptr is the lowest address of the memory

// allocated by alloca, the memory can be accessed using ptr up to (ptr + size of allocated memory).

stacksave ptr;
```

st.local.u32 [ptr], ra;     // Use the allocated stack memory

stackrestore.u32 stackptr;  // Deallocate memory by restoring the stack pointer
