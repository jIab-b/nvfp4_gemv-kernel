### 9.3.1. Comparisons 

#### 9.3.1.1. [Integer and Bit-Size Comparisons](#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons)[](#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons "Permalink to this headline")

The signed integer comparisons are the traditional `eq` (equal), `ne` (not-equal), `lt`
(less-than), `le` (less-than-or-equal), `gt` (greater-than), and `ge`
(greater-than-or-equal). The unsigned comparisons are `eq`, `ne`, `lo` (lower), `ls`
(lower-or-same), `hi` (higher), and `hs` (higher-or-same). The bit-size comparisons are `eq`
and `ne`; ordering comparisons are not defined for bit-size types.

[Table 22](#integer-and-bit-size-comparisons-operators-for-signed-integer-unsigned-integer-and-bit-size-types)
shows the operators for signed integer, unsigned integer, and bit-size types.

| Meaning | Signed Operator | Unsigned Operator | Bit-Size Operator |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `a == b` | `eq` | `eq` | `eq` |
| `a != b` | `ne` | `ne` | `ne` |
| `a < b` | `lt` | `lo` | n/a |
| `a <= b` | `le` | `ls` | n/a |
| `a > b` | `gt` | `hi` | n/a |
| `a >= b` | `ge` | `hs` | n/a |

#### 9.3.1.2. [Floating Point Comparisons](#floating-point-comparisons)[](#floating-point-comparisons "Permalink to this headline")

The ordered floating-point comparisons are `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, and `ge`. If
either operand is `NaN`, the result is
`False`. [Table 23](#floating-point-comparisons-floating-point-operators) lists the floating-point
comparison operators.

Table 23 Floating-Point Comparison Operators[](#floating-point-comparisons-floating-point-operators "Permalink to this table")




| Meaning | Floating-Point Operator |
| --- | --- |
| `a == b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `eq` |
| `a != b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `ne` |
| `a < b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `lt` |
| `a <= b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `le` |
| `a > b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `gt` |
| `a >= b && !isNaN(a) && !isNaN(b)` | `ge` |

To aid comparison operations in the presence of `NaN` values, unordered floating-point comparisons
are provided: `equ`, `neu`, `ltu`, `leu`, `gtu`, and `geu`. If both operands are numeric
values (not `NaN`), then the comparison has the same result as its ordered counterpart. If either
operand is `NaN`, then the result of the comparison is `True`.

[Table 24](#floating-point-comparisons-floating-point-operators-nan) lists the floating-point
comparison operators accepting `NaN` values.

| Meaning | Floating-Point Operator |
| --- | --- |
| `a == b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `equ` |
| `a != b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `neu` |
| `a < b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `ltu` |
| `a <= b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `leu` |
| `a > b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `gtu` |
| `a >= b || isNaN(a) || isNaN(b)` | `geu` |

To test for `NaN` values, two operators `num` (`numeric`) and `nan` (`isNaN`) are
provided. `num` returns `True` if both operands are numeric values (not `NaN`), and `nan`
returns `True` if either operand is
`NaN`. [Table 25](#floating-point-comparisons-floating-point-operators-testing-nan) lists the
floating-point comparison operators testing for `NaN` values.
